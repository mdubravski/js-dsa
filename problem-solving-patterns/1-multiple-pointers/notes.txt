Multiple Pointers
  - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move 
    towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.
  - Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
  - use over ds with linear structure (ex. array, string, linked list, ...)
