What is Recursion?
	- A process (a function in our case) that calls itself
	- Every iterative function can be written recursivly
	- Examples of recursion are everywhere!
		- JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
		- document.getElementById and DOM traversal
		- Object traversal
		- Much more!
	- We will see it w/ more complex data structres 
	- It is sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
