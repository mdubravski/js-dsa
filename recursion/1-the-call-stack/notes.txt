The Call Stack
	- In alost all programming languages, there is a built in data structure that
	  manages what hapens when function are invoked...its called the call stack!
	- Implemented using a stack data structure
		- Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of the 
		 call stack.
		- When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the
		  compiler will remove (pop)
	- When we write recursive functions, we keep pushing new functions onto the call 	   stack
