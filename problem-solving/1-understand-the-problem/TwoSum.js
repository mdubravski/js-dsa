 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * time => O(1)
 * space => O(1)
 * 
 *   1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
 *      - make a function which returns two number added together
 *   2. What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
 *      - ints?
 *      - floats?
 *      - large numbers (string)?
 *   3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
 *      - the sum of the two inputs
 *      - int/float/string?
 *   4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words,
 *      do I have enough information to solve the problem?
 *      - yes
 *   5. How should I label the important pieces of data that a part of the problem?
 *      - inputs x,y 
 *
