4 -- Solve Or Simplify
----------------------------------------------------

Solve the problem if you can!
  - if you can not solve the problem, solve a simpler problem!

Simplify
  - find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
  - temporarily ignore th at difficulty
  - write a simplified solution
  - then incorporate that difficulty back in
