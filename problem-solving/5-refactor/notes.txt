Refactoring Questions
  - Can you check the result?
  - Can you derive the result differently?
  - Can you understand it at a glance?
  - Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
  - Can you improve the performance of your solution?
  - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  - How have other people solved this problem?
