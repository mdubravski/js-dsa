3 -- Break It Down
----------------------------------------------------

Explicitly write out the steps you need to take! 
  - this forces you to think about the code you'll write before
    you write it
  - helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or 
    misunderstanding before you dive in and have to 
    worry about the details (language syntax) as well
